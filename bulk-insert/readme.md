# Bulk insert documents in Azure AI Search using Python

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This sample creates and loads a search index using bulk insert operations with the good-books sample dataset. It demonstrates efficient document indexing patterns for large datasets.

## What's in this sample

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bulk-insert.py` | Python script that creates and loads the search index |
| `good-books-index.json` | Index schema definition |
| `requirements.txt` | Python package dependencies |

## Documentation

This sample is the Python version of the `bulk-insert` content used in [Tutorial: Add search to web apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/tutorial-csharp-overview). You can substitute this code to create a Python version of the sample app. You can also run this code on its own to create a good-books index on your search service.

## Next step

You can learn more about Azure AI Search on the [official documentation site](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search).
