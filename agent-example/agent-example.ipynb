       "To find lava at night, you can look for the distinct infrared glow emitted from active lava flows using satellite imagery. Here are key strategies to locate lava at night:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Infrared Imaging**: Satellite instruments, such as the VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on polar-orbiting satellites, use infrared wavelengths to detect the heat emitted by lava. This is particularly useful for observing glowing lava flows even in the absence of visible light sources ([ref_id: 3](3), [ref_id: 4](4)).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Thermal Imaging**: Satellites equipped with thermal infrared sensors, like the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8, can capture the thermal signature of hot lava. This enables identification of active vents and flowing lava, which are distinguishable from cooler surroundings ([ref_id: 4](4)).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Clear Night Observations**: Clear nights with sufficient moonlight can aid in the visibility of glowing lava flows. Under the right conditions, both natural light and artificial satellite illumination can highlight volcanic activity ([ref_id: 5](5)).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Satellite Images**: Nighttime satellite images, such as those capturing eruptions from Mount Etna or Kilauea, display bright clusters and flows of lava distinctly different from nearby city lights. Observing these images can help locate the precise positions of active lava ([ref_id: 0](0), [ref_id: 1](1), [ref_id: 2](2)).\n",
       "\n",
       "By utilizing these methods, you can effectively track and monitor lava flows at night for both scientific research and public safety purposes."
