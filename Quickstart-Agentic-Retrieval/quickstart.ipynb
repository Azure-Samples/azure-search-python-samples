Phoenix is situated in the central part of Arizona, which is in the southwestern region of the United States.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Grid of City Blocks-Phoenix, Arizona\\n\\nLike many large urban areas of the central and western United States, the Phoenix metropolitan area is laid out along a regular grid of city blocks and streets. While visible during the day, this grid is most evident at night, when the pattern of street lighting is clearly visible from the low-Earth-orbit vantage point of the ISS.\\n\\nThis astronaut photograph, taken on March 16, 2013, includes parts of several cities in the metropolitan area, including Phoenix (image right), Glendale (center), and Peoria (left). While the major street grid is oriented north-south, the northwest-southeast oriented Grand Avenue cuts across the three cities at image center. Grand Avenue is a major transportation corridor through the western metropolitan area; the lighting patterns of large industrial and commercial properties are visible along its length. Other brightly lit properties include large shopping centers, strip malls, and gas stations, which tend to be located at the intersections of north-south and east-west trending streets.\\n\\nThe urban grid encourages growth outwards along a city's borders by providing optimal access to new real estate. Fueled by the adoption of widespread personal automobile use during the twentieth century, the Phoenix metropolitan area today includes 25 other municipalities (many of them largely suburban and residential) linked by a network of surface streets and freeways.\\n\\nWhile much of the land area highlighted in this image is urbanized, there are several noticeably dark areas. The Phoenix Mountains are largely public parks and recreational land. To the west, agricultural fields provide a sharp contrast to the lit streets of residential developments. The Salt River channel appears as a dark ribbon within the urban grid.\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\\\"Earth at Night\\\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\\\"88\\\" -->\"\n",

The highlighted location represents the geographical focus of the text discussion on US urban development and transportation networks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Urban Development\\n\\n### Lighting Paths\\u2014Across the United States\\n\\nThe United States has more miles of roads than any other nation in the world\\u20144.1 million miles (6.6 million kilometers) to be precise, which is roughly 40 percent more than second-ranked India. About 47,000 miles (75,639 kilometers) of those roads are part of the Interstate Highway System, established by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. The country also has 127,000 miles (204,000 kilometers) of railroad tracks and about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) of navigable rivers and canals (not including the Great Lakes). The imprint of that transportation web becomes easy to see at night.\\n\\nThe VIIRS DNB on the Suomi NPP satellite acquired this nighttime view (top image, right) of the continental United States on October 1, 2013. The roadway map (bottom image, right) traces the path of the major interstate highways, railroads, and rivers of the United States. Comparing the two images, you quickly see how the cities and settlements align with the transportation corridors. In the early days of the republic, post roads and toll roads for horse-drawn carts and carriages were built to connect eastern cities like Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, though relatively few travelers made the long, unlit journeys. Railroads became the dominant transportation method for people and cargo in the middle of the nineteenth century, establishing longer links across the Nation and waypoints across the Midwest, the Great Plains, and the Rockies. Had nighttime satellite images existed in that era, they probably would show only dim pearls of light around major cities in the east and scattered across the country; the strands of steel tracks and cobbled roads that connected them would be invisible from space.\\n\\nEventually, cars and trucks became the dominant form of transportation in the United States. Drivers then needed roads and lighting to keep them safe on those roads. As the Nation grew in the twentieth century, the development of new cities and suburbs often conformed to the path of the interstate highways, adding light along the paths between the cities.\\n\\nOver the years, the length of navigable rivers has been a constant, as is their relative lack of light. Even today the only light seems to be the occasional port cities along riverbanks and the light of ships themselves.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Table: Summary of U.S. Transportation Infrastructure**\\n\\n| Infrastructure Type     | Total Mileage (mi) | Total Mileage (km) |\\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\\n| Roads (All)            | 4,100,000          | 6,600,000          |\\n| Interstate Highways    | 47,000             | 75,639             |\\n| Railroads              | 127,000            | 204,000            |\\n| Navigable Rivers/Canals| 25,000             | 40,000             |\\n\\n---\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\\\"108 Earth at Night\\\" -->\"\n",

The activity was accompanied by 130 earthquakes occurring over three hours that morning. Mount Etna, Europe\\u2019s most active volcano, has seen periodic activity on this part of the mountain since 2013. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired the main image of Mount Etna on December 28, 2018.\\n\\nThe inset image highlights the active vent and thermal infrared signature from lava flows, which can be seen near the newly formed fissure on the southeastern side of the volcano. The inset was created with data from OLI and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8. Ash spewing from the fissure cloaked adjacent villages and delayed aircraft from landing at the nearby Catania airport. Earthquakes occurred in the subsequent days after the initial eruption and displaced hundreds of people from their homes.\\n\\nFor nighttime images of Mount Etna\\u2019s March 2017 eruption, see pages 48\\u201351.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Hazards of Volcanic Ash Plumes and Satellite Observation\\n\\nWith the help of moonlight, satellite instruments can track volcanic ash plumes, which present significant hazards to airplanes in flight. The volcanic ash\\u2014composed of tiny pieces of glass and rock\\u2014is abrasive to engine turbine blades, and can melt on the blades and other engine parts, causing damage and even engine stalls. This poses a danger to both the plane\\u2019s integrity and passenger safety. Volcanic ash also reduces visibility for pilots and can cause etching of windshields, further reducing pilots\\u2019 ability to see. Nightlight images can be combined with thermal images to provide a more complete view of volcanic activity on Earth\\u2019s surface.\\n\\nThe VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on polar-orbiting satellites uses faint light sources such as moonlight, airglow (the atmosphere\\u2019s self-illumination through chemical reactions), zodiacal light (sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust), and starlight from the Milky Way. Using these dim light sources, the DNB can detect changes in clouds, snow cover, and sea ice:\\n\\n#### Table: Light Sources Used by VIIRS DNB\\n\\n| Light Source         | Description                                                                  |\\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Moonlight            | Reflected sunlight from the Moon, illuminating Earth's surface at night      |\\n| Airglow              | Atmospheric self-illumination from chemical reactions                        |\\n| Zodiacal Light       | Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust                                    |\\n| Starlight/Milky Way  | Faint illumination provided by stars in the Milky Way                        |\\n\\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), managed by NOAA, orbit over Earth\\u2019s equator and offer uninterrupted observations of North America. High-latitude areas such as Alaska benefit from polar-orbiting satellites like Suomi NPP, which provide overlapping coverage at the poles, enabling more data collection in these regions. During polar darkness (winter months), VIIRS DNB data allow scientists to:\\n\\n- Observe sea ice formation\\n- Monitor snow cover extent at the highest latitudes\\n- Detect open water for ship navigation\\n\\n#### Table: Satellite Coverage Overview\\n\\n| Satellite Type          | Orbit           | Coverage Area         | Special Utility                              |\\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\\n| GOES                   | Geostationary   | Equatorial/North America | Continuous regional monitoring              |\\n| Polar-Orbiting (e.g., Suomi NPP) | Polar-orbiting    | Poles/high latitudes      | Overlapping passes; useful during polar night|\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weather Forecasting and Nightlight Data\\n\\nThe use of nightlight data by weather forecasters is growing as the VIIRS instrument enables observation of clouds at night illuminated by sources such as moonlight and lightning. Scientists use these data to study the nighttime behavior of weather systems, including severe storms, which can develop and strike populous areas at night as well as during the day. Combined with thermal data, visible nightlight data allow the detection of clouds at various heights in the atmosphere, such as dense marine fog. This capability enables weather forecasters to issue marine advisories with higher confidence, leading to greater utility. (See \\\"Marine Layer Clouds\\u2014California\\\" on page 56.)\\n\\nIn this section of the book, you will see how nightlight data are used to observe nature\\u2019s spectacular light shows across a wide range of sources.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Notable Data from Mount Etna Flank Eruption (December 2018)\\n\\n| Event/Observation                  | Details                                                                    |\\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Date of Flank Eruption              | December 24, 2018                                                          |\\n| Number of Earthquakes               | 130 earthquakes within 3 hours                                              |\\n| Image Acquisition                   | December 28, 2018 by Landsat 8 OLI                                         |\\n| Location of Eruption                | Southeastern side of Mount Etna                                            |\\n| Thermal Imaging Data                | From OLI and TIRS (Landsat 8), highlighting active vent and lava flows     |\\n| Impact on Villages/Air Transport    | Ash covered villages; delayed aircraft at Catania airport                  |\\n| Displacement                        | Hundreds of residents displaced                                            |\\n| Ongoing Seismic Activity            | Earthquakes continued after initial eruption                               |\\n\\n---\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\\\"Earth at Night\\\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\\\"30\\\" -->\"\n",
