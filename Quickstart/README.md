# Python quickstart for Azure AI Search

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Demonstrates using Python and the Azure SDK for Python to create an Azure AI Search index, load it with documents, and execute a few queries. The index is modeled on a subset of the Hotels dataset, reduced for readability and comprehension. Index definition and documents are included in the code.

This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file to perform the actions against the Azure AI Search service.

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code with the Python extension (or equivalent tool), with Python 3.10 or later

* [azure-search-documents package](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/) from the Azure SDK for Python

## Set up the sample

1. Clone or download this sample repository.

1. Extract contents if the download is a zip file. Make sure the files are read-write.

## Run the sample

1. Open the azure-search-quickstart.ipynb file in Visual Studio Code.

1. Set the service endpoint and API key for your search service:

   * service_name = "YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME"
   * admin_key = "YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-ADMIN-API-KEY"

1. Run each step in sequence.
