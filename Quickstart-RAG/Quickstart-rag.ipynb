    "# RAG Quickstart for Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart provides a query for RAG scenarios. It demonstrates an approach for a chat experience using grounding data from a search index on Azure AI Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a few shortcuts to keep the exercise basic and focused on query definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the hotels-sample-index, which can be created in minutes and runs on any search service tier. This index is created by a wizard using built-in sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We omit vectors so that we can skip chunking and embedding. The index contains plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the fundamentals of integrating queries from Azure AI Search to an LLM, you can build on that experience by adding vector fields and vector and hybrid queries. We recommend the [phi-chat Python code example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/phi-chat/phi-chat.ipynb) for that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is fully documented in [Quickstart: Generative search (RAG) with grounding data from Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-rag). If you need more guidance than the readme provides, please refer to the article.\n"

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Deploy a chat model (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, or equivalent LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Basic tier or higher is recommended.\n",
    "  - Choose the same region as Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "  - Enable semantic ranking.\n",
    "  - Enable role-based access control.\n",
    "  - Enable a system identity for Azure AI Search.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Make sure you know the name of the deployed model, and have the endpoints for both Azure resources at hand. You will provide this information in the steps that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure access\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart assumes authentication and authorization using Microsoft Entra ID and role assignments. It also assumes that you run this code from your local device.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To create, load, and query the sample index on Azure AI Search, you must personally have role assignments for: **Search Index Data Reader**, **Search Index Data Contributor**, **Search Service Contributor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To send the query and search results to Azure OpenAI, both you and the search system identity must have **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** permissions on Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Queries in the system prompt are sent from your local system, which is why you need permissions on Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "   - Results used for grounding data are sent from the search engine, which is why the search service needs permissions on Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create the sample index\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart assumes the hotels-sample-index, which you can create in minutes using [this quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the index exists, modify it in the Azure portal to use this semantic configuration:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    \"semantic\": {\n",
    "    \"defaultConfiguration\": \"semantic-config\",\n",
    "    \"configurations\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"semantic-config\",\n",
    "        \"prioritizedFields\": {\n",
    "          \"titleField\": { \"fieldName\": \"HotelName\" },\n",

    "            { \"fieldName\": \"Tags\" }\n",
    "          ]}\n",
    "       }]},\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your Azure resources, an index, and model in place, you can run the script to chat with the index."
