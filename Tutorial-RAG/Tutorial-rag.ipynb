    "Steps in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up the environment\n",
    "- Set up the Azure resources used in the pipeline\n",
    "- Create an index, data source, skillset, and indexer on Azure AI Search\n",
    "- Send a query to the search engine to check results\n",
    "- Send a query to an LLM to chat with your data\n",
    "- Revisit the index schema and query logic to improve relevance\n",

The index created in the last step uses half-precision floating-point numbers (float16) for the text vectors. This reduces the storage requirements for the vectors by half compared to the previous index that used single-precision floating-point numbers (float32). Scalar compression and the omission of one set of the vecctors account for the remaining storage savings. For more information about reducing vector size, see [Choose an approach for optimizing vector storage and processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-configure-compression-storage).\n",
