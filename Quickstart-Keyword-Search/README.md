# Quickstart: Keyword search in Azure AI Search using Python

![Flask sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This sample demonstrates how to use the Azure SDK for Python to create an Azure AI Search index, load it with documents, and execute queries. The index is modeled on a subset of the hotels dataset, which is reduced in this sample for readability and comprehension. The code includes the index definition and documents.

This sample uses a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file to perform the actions against the Azure AI Search service.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/).

* The [azure-search-documents package](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/) from the Azure SDK for Python.

## Set up the sample

1. Clone or download this sample repository.

1. Extract contents if the download is a ZIP file. Make sure the files are read-write.

## Run the sample

1. Open the `azure-search-quickstart.ipynb` file in Visual Studio Code.

1. Set `search_endpoint` to the endpoint URL of your Azure AI Search service.

1. Run each code cell in sequence.

## Next step

You can learn more about Azure AI Search on the [official documentation site](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search).
