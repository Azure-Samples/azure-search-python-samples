      "**1. Why do suburban belts display larger December brightening than urban cores, even though absolute light levels are higher downtown?**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Suburban belts show a *larger percentage increase* in night brightness during December compared to urban cores, largely because suburban residential areas feature more single-family homes and larger yards, which are typically decorated with holiday lights. These areas start from a lower baseline (less bright overall at night compared to dense urban centers), so the relative change (brightening) is much more noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In contrast, the downtown core is already very bright at night due to dense commercial lighting and streetlights. While it also sees a December increase (often 20–30% brighter), the *absolute* change is less striking because it begins at a much higher base of illumination.\n",
      "\n",
      "- This pattern is observed across U.S. cities, with the phenomenon driven by widespread cultural practices and the suburban landscape’s suitability for holiday lighting displays. The effect is visible in satellite data and was quantified at 20–50% brighter in December, especially in suburbs and city outskirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Why is the Phoenix nighttime street grid so sharply visible from space, whereas large stretches of the interstate between midwestern cities remain comparatively dim?**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Phoenix’s sharply visible nighttime street grid from space is a result of its urban layout: the city (like many western U.S. cities) was developed using a regular grid system, with extensive and uniform street lighting and strong urban sprawl. The grid pattern, and the dense network of intersecting surface streets, is brightly illuminated, particularly at intersections, commercial areas, and major thoroughfares.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The interstate highways between midwestern cities, though significant in length and crucial to national infrastructure, traverse sparsely populated rural areas. These stretches typically have very little artificial lighting (due to low traffic volumes at night and cost considerations), making them much less visible in nighttime satellite imagery. Only nodes (cities and towns) along the route show as bright \"pearls\" in the darkness, while the \"strings\" (highways) connecting them remain faint or invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In summary:\n",
      "  - Urban areas like Phoenix stand out with strong, connected patterns of light due to dense development and extensive lighting.\n",
      "  - Rural interstates are sparsely lit, and only their endpoints—cities and large towns—generate notable light visible from space.\n",
