# Create an Azure function that specifies queries

This folder contains source code for an Azure function that formulates queries, document look up, and suggestions for typeahead queries. It's the Python version of the `api` content used in the [C# sample Add search to websites](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/tutorial-csharp-overview). If you're a Python developer, you can subtitute this code to create a Python version of the sample app.
