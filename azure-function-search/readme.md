# Create an Azure function that specifies queries

This folder contains source code for an Azure function that formulates queries, performs document lookup, and suggests typeahead queries. It's the Python version of the `api` content used in the [C# sample Add search to websites](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/tutorial-csharp-overview). If you're a Python developer, you can substitute this code to create a Python version of the sample app.
